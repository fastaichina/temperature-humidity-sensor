Temperature-Humidity-Sensor
===========================
This page contains the code required for fowolling the step by step guide to install a temperature&Humidity sensor on your Raspberry Pi (Revision 2 type) that you can find at http://www.jorditorres.org/how-to-install-a-temperature-humidity-sensor-on-your-raspberry-pi-a-step-by-step-guide-2/ 

It is  written by Bernat Torres and myself. It was an amazing experience for us!.  The prototype build in this hands-on is part of the scientific project of the secondary school in our town. It is an execellent example to show the diverse areas that comprise the current technological scenario. We didnâ€™t found any tutorial that could be followed by a secondary school students in order to build a sensor prototype like this. For this reason Bernat and I think that it will be useful for other students to sumarize our knowledge and share this hands-on.

This tutorial is a taste of various current technologies in a holistic way: Electronics, Hardware, System Software, Applications, Programming Language, Internet of Services, etc. We hope that you enjoy it!

NOTE: Some of the files are based of code for the Raspberry Pi written by the project AirPi.es (thank you!)
